Copy the questions below into the firt-lastname.txt file on your github repo - answer each question and then push your changes. 

    1. What is Semantic HTML? 

	Semantic HTML is markup that provides meaning to its content's organization, 
	making it easier for humans and machines to understand (which improves SEO and 
	accessibility for screen readers, etc.).
	
    2. What is HTML used for? 

	HTML is used to wrap and organize elements (content) giving them (it) structure
	and meaning in the context of a document.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 

	An attribute is piece of additional information added to an HTML element (such as 
	"height" or "width" on an <img> element. It is placed after the name of the
	opening tag of an element (or simply after the name of a self-closing tag). 

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?

	The h1 tag is used to designate the main heading of a page and is best used only 	once.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes

	1) An a "anchor" tag must have an href attribute. 
	2) An img "image" tag must have an src attribute. 
	(Although I would imagine that exceptions do exist?)

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 

	The head of an HTML document typically contains a links to css stylesheets, one or
	more meta elements and a title element. 

    7. What is an id? 

	An id is an attribute that can be added to an HTML element to in turn be accessed
	by a CSS id selector. Ids should be used sparingly due to their selector's high 
	specificity weight.

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 

	An id attribute can be added to any HTML element (source: w3schools.com)

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 

	A given id can only be used once per page.

    10. What is a class? 

	A class is an attribute that can be added to HTML elements to in turn be accessed
	by CSS class selectors. It's usefulness lies in the fact that it can be used 
	multiple times in a given document / stylesheet.

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 

	A class attribute can be added to any HTML element. 

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 

	The same class can be used as many times as necessary.

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?

	A link can be directed to open in a new tab by adding the target="_blank"
	attribute to the a "anchor" element containing the link.

    14. What is the alt attribute used for? 

	The alt attribute is added to image elements to provide information regarding an 
	image in case it doesn't render properly on the page, or a screen reader is in 
	use (for a visually impaired user, for example).

    15. How do I reference an id?

	An id attribute can be referenced by a CSS id selector, which accesses the HTML 
	element with the id and styles it accordingly as follows:

	#id1 {
	   border: solid red 5px;
	)

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div?

	A section element is considered more semantic (that is, it provides more meaning
	within the context of an HTML document) than a div element (which is considered to
	be more of a generic container element). 

    17. What is CSS used for? 

	CSS is used to style the content (markup) found in HTML documents. 

    18. How do we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page

	A CSS ruleset is used to select an element. Rulesets contain a selector and a 
	declaration: which in turn consists of a property and its corresponding value 
	as in the following example:

	h2 {
	  color: green;
	}

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one

	Perhaps the main difference between a class and an id is the number of times each
	may be used (in addition to the fact that an id has greater specificity). A class
	may be used as many times as needed, while an id may only be used once per page.
	For example, a class might be used to style all the paragraphs on a page to give 
	them all identical font size, while an id might be used to style a single heading
	tag (amongst many) to make it stand out from the rest.	

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?

	A class selector, consisting of a dot preceding the class name in question, is 
	used to select classes in CSS, as in the following example:

	.class1 {
	   font-size: 20px;
	}

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human”?

	p.human {
	   background: blue;
	}
	   

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 

	A parent child selector only selects elements of a certain type that are direct 
	children of a parent element (and not grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so
	on...). For example:

	section > h2 {
	   color: blue;
	}

	This would be useful in cases where there are multiple layers of elements nested 
	within each other in a similar pattern and one only wants to style the first 
	"layer" or "generation" of a given element type. 	

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?

	div.sidebar a {
	   color: orange;
	}
	   

    24. What is a pseudo selector?

	A pseudo selector focuses on the state of an element rather than its mere presence  	as a conventional selector would. A good example is the :hover suffix added to a 
	selector to cause the styling to be applied when the user hovers (their cursor,
	finger, etc.) over the element in question. For example:

	p:hover {
	   color: yellow;
	}

    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?

	The line-height property is used to change the (vertical) spacing between lines as
	in the following example:

	p {
	 line-height: 1.5;
	}

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?

	The letter-spacing property is used to change the spacing between letters as in 
	the following example:

	p {
	 letter-spacing: 1.5px;
	}

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?

	The text-transform property is used to modify text as follows:

	p {
	 text-transform: uppercase;
	}

    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?

	div {
	   border: dotted black 1px;
	}

    29. How do I select everything on the page? 
	
	To select everything on the page, the universal selector is used as follows:

	* {
	  font-size: 15;
	}

    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?

	Content is "commented out" in CSS by wrapping code in the following: 

	/* <content to be commented out> */

    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line? 

	The pwd (print working directory) command notifies the user of what file they are  	in.

    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?

	The ls command will list the files/folders in the current folder.

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 

	The rm <name of file> command removes files. One reason to be careful with this 
	command is the fact that the deleted content is completely deleted and not sent to 	a retrievable trash folder.

    34. Why should I use version control? 

	Version control allows for secure copies of code to be kept while other copies are
	modified risk-free. It also allows for collaboration between and among 
	programmers. 

    35. How often should I commit to github?

	It is best to commit to GitHub frequently, as in at least hourly, but preferably
	every 15 minutes or so. One should also commit prior to extended breaks and, of 
	course, at the end of work sessions.

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 

	git push -u origin 'Name of branch'

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 

	1) A repo on GitHub is forked in order to create a student's copy.
	2) The student invites their TL's to be collaborators on the forked repo (for 
	   review/grading purposes).
	3) The repo is cloned placing it 'locally' on the student's computer.
	4) A branch of the repo is made on which to complete assignments.
	5) The branch is pushed back to GitHub where a pull request is made and the branch 	   is compared to the master (student's fork). 
	6) The branch is merged back into the fork by a TL.
